### Short Answer Questions

**Question 1** \
<ins>Discuss the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating responsive web pages. Explain the significance of asynchronous programming in improving web page load times and user experience. (4)</ins>
\
\
HTML, CSS and JavaScript each play a distinct yet independent role in creating responsive web pages. HTML provides the structural foundation by organizing content onto different parts such as HEAD or BODY that are used alone with CSS and Javascript to create adaptive and responsive web pages. CSS controls the visual presentation and layout, using tools such as queries and flexible grid systems to allow for the web page to respond and adapt across devices of different sizes, resolutions and orientation. JavaScript adds interactivity and responsive behaviors enabling real-time content updates such as dropdowns and sliders that adjusts the content on-screen and responsive adjustments based on user input or the dimensions of the screen. Together, these technologies ensure that web pages are both adaptable and engaging. However, responsiveness alone does not guarantee optimal performance. Through the use of asynchronous programming, it allows for web pages to load and update content without blocking the main web page. This improves load times and enhances user experience by enabling smooth interactions. One great example of this is Gmail. When it launched in 2004, it used asynchronous Javascript rather than synchronous page reloads used by services such as Yahoo Mail and Hotmail. This allowed for emails to be loaded quickly, searches to be performed quickly and the user interactions felt seamless because it was all being preloaded in the background. That's why Gmail is so dominant today. By combining responsive designs using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as asynchronous programming, it allows for a web application to be adaptive and efficient, improving the load times and user experience as well as making it responsive to all kinds of devices.

**Question 2**\
<ins>Explain how a slow page loading can impact user engagement and suggest web programming techniques to improve it. (2)</ins>
\
\
Slow page loading can significantly impact the user's engagement by increasing the bounce rates, make them frustrated and give off unreliable effects. A website that takes more than 10 seconds to load often see a massive dropout in attention as users abandon the page. It increases dissatisfaction and gives off negative perceptions of the brand and website. To improve the load times, developers can use techniques such as asynchronous programming which allows for the pages contents like images or branches of the website to load quietly in the background so that it is already rendered when the user wants to view it. Other aspects such as optimizing asset like compressing images can further improve the loading time and thus increase user engagement.
